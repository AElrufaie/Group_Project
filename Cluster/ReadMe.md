Since our dataset contains over 150,000 rows, we used a random sample of 25,000 - 30,000 rows for the clustering portion.

For this code file "Clustering_(DB_K_Proto)_Insy695.ipynb" the dataset used is called animal_df, which is stored in the dataset branch. Furthermore, for the exploration of the best performing cluster, we have used this dataset "kprototypes_clusters.csv". This dataset can be found in the "Dataset with Cluster Label" folder which is stored in the "Cluster" folder
