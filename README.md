#**PAWsitive-Tails-Shaping-Brighter-Futures-for-Shelter-Pets**

Project Overview:

This project is a comprehensive data science initiative focused on improving the lives of animals in shelters. Using the attached file as the primary data source—which includes details on animal demographics, health status, intake reasons (such as old age, sickness, or behavioral issues), and outcomes (like adoption, euthanasia, or transfer)—the project aims to leverage advanced analytical methods to predict shelter animal outcomes and optimize resource allocation.

Objectives and Goals:

Predictive Modeling:

Develop state-of-the-art supervised learning models (such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and other ensemble techniques) to accurately predict the outcome of shelter animals. Performance will be primarily evaluated using the AUC-ROC metric to ensure robust model validation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering:

Conduct an in-depth EDA to uncover trends, correlations, and anomalies within the data. Through meticulous feature engineering, we aim to enhance model performance and reveal critical factors that drive animal outcomes.

Unsupervised Learning Insights:

Utilize unsupervised learning techniques like clustering and anomaly detection to identify latent patterns and groupings among the animals. This step will help in understanding complex relationships in the data that may not be immediately evident through supervised methods alone.

Causal Inference:

Apply causal inference methods to test hypotheses regarding the impact of specific features (for example, age, medical condition, or intake reason) on the outcome. This analysis will help determine whether these factors causally influence outcomes, guiding more effective interventions.

Resource Allocation for Shelters:

Translate data-driven insights into actionable strategies that enable shelters to better allocate funding and resources. By anticipating the needs of shelter animals through predictive analytics, shelters can implement proactive measures that enhance animal welfare and increase successful outcomes.

Impact:

At its core, this project is passionate about transforming negative trajectories—such as euthanasia or prolonged shelter stays—into positive, life-changing outcomes for animals. By merging innovative data science techniques with a commitment to animal welfare, the project strives to provide shelters with the insights needed to make informed decisions, optimize care processes, and ultimately ensure a brighter future for every animal in their care.
